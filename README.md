#Virtual Controller Angle Tutorial

Divide the virtual controller into three sections.

For the y-axis, the mouse point is either:

1. above the center of the controller
2. below the center of the controller
3. at the same height of the center of the controller

## Mouse Point Located Above Controller Center

If the mouse point is above the center of the controller, than check for one of three conditions:

1. x is to the right of the controller
2. x is to the left of the controller
3. x is at the same point as the centerx of the controller

### Mouse point is located above and to the right of controller
